# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We are committed to fostering a welcoming and inclusive community. We pledge to create a space where everyone feels respected, valued, and safe to participate, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We believe that our community should be a place for learning, sharing, and collaboration. We encourage open and honest discussion, and we are dedicated to ensuring that our project and its community are harassment-free.

## Our Standards

We expect all members of our community to abide by the following standards:

*   **Be inclusive and respectful:** Use welcoming language and be considerate of the diverse backgrounds and perspectives of others.
*   **Respectful Expression of Opinions:** We value diverse perspectives and believe that conversations on a variety of topics, including religion and politics, can be constructive. Everyone is welcome to their own opinions. However, in all common group channels, discussions must be conducted with respect and relevance to the project. They must remain constructive, on-topic, and not devolve into personal attacks or unproductive disputes. The project leadership reserves the right to moderate, redirect, or end any discussion that becomes disruptive or violates this Code of Conduct.
*   **Accept constructive criticism gracefully:** We all make mistakes, and we can all learn from them.
*   **Focus on what's best for the community:** Be mindful of how your words and actions might affect others.
*   **Show empathy:** Try to understand things from other people's perspectives.

### AI-Assisted Contributions

We welcome contributions that have been assisted by artificial intelligence tools. However, the contributor remains fully responsible for the entirety of their contribution. By submitting code, you are agreeing that you understand it, have tested it, and are responsible for any breakage or issues that may arise from it.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

*   **Harassment and Bullying:** This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   Offensive comments related to the characteristics mentioned in "Our Pledge."
    *   Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
    *   Public or private harassment.
*   **Sexualized Language and Imagery:** Unwelcome sexual attention or advances are not permitted.
*   **Publishing Private Information:** Do not share others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission (doxing).
*   **Other Inappropriate Conduct:** Any other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.
*   **Illegal Content:** Posting content that is illegal or of dubious legality (e.g., illegally obtained copyrighted material, tools for circumventing DRM).

Violating these standards may lead to temporary or permanent exclusion from the community, as determined by the project maintainers.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct. They may also ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including our repositories, forums, and any other official communication channels. It also applies in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

## Enforcement

If you witness or are the subject of unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by contacting the project team. All reports will be handled with discretion and will be reviewed and investigated promptly.

The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

## Acknowledgment

This Code of Conduct is inspired by and adapted from other open source codes of conduct. We are grateful for the work of other communities in establishing these important standards.
